# About Quote Vault

Quote Vault is a full-stack web application designed as a practice project to explore and implement modern web development technologies. The application allows users to manage inspirational quotes, including features to add, delete, and list quotes, as well as create custom categories for organizing them.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Hono**: A lightweight and fast web framework for Node.js, used to build the API with a focus on simplicity and performance.
- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for executing server-side JavaScript.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight, serverless database for storing quotes and categories.
- **Prisma**: A modern ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for TypeScript, providing type-safe database access and schema management.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and enhances code maintainability across the backend.

### Frontend
- **Vue 3**: A progressive JavaScript framework for building reactive and component-based user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Used for type-safe development in the frontend, ensuring robust and maintainable code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive UI styling.
- **DaisyUI**: A Tailwind CSS component library for pre-built, customizable UI components.
- **Vue Router**: Handles client-side routing for seamless navigation within the application.

## Purpose
This project serves as a hands-on learning experience for integrating **Hono** and **Vue 3** with modern tools like TypeScript, Prisma, and Tailwind CSS. It demonstrates a complete full-stack workflow, from database management to a dynamic frontend, with plans for potential feature expansions in the future.
